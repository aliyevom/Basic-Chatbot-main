A brief description of the project
A simple chatbot built using deep learning techniques is the result of this Python project. A dataset containing categories (intents), patterns, and responses is used to train the chatbot. To determine which category the user's message belongs to, I used recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) and then generated a random response based on the list of possible responses.
